🌟 Student Performance Prediction 📚🎓
📊 Overview
Welcome to the Student Performance Prediction project! 🚀 This project focuses on predicting students' math scores based on various factors such as:

👦 Gender
🌍 Race/Ethnicity
🎓 Parental Level of Education
🍽️ Lunch Type
📚 Test Preparation Course
By analyzing these parameters, we aim to identify key influences on academic performance and develop a predictive model that can help educators understand and enhance student outcomes. ✨

🗃️ Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains the following features:

👨‍🎓 Gender: Gender of the student (e.g., male, female)
🌈 Race/Ethnicity: Ethnic background of the student (e.g., group A, group B, etc.)
🎓 Parental Level of Education: Highest level of education attained by the parents (e.g., high school, associate's degree, etc.)
🍽️ Lunch: Type of lunch received (e.g., standard, free/reduced)
📚 Test Preparation Course: Whether the student completed a test preparation course (e.g., completed, none)
📐 Math Score: Score obtained in the math subject (🎯 Target Variable)
📖 Reading Score: Score obtained in the reading subject
✍️ Writing Score: Score obtained in the writing subject
🔍 Data Description
The dataset is structured as a CSV file, making it easy to manipulate and analyze using popular data analysis libraries like Pandas and NumPy in Python. 📈

🎯 Objectives
📈 Analyze the correlation between various factors and math scores.
🤖 Build a predictive model to estimate math scores based on input features.
📊 Visualize data relationships and trends for better understanding and presentation.
